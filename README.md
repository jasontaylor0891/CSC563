## Project 1
For this project, I created a benchmarking tool to compute a computer's computational performance.  I designed this benchmarking tool to measures the CPU speed for floating-point operations per second (Giga FLOPS) and integer operations per second (Giga IOPS).  This benchmarking tool measures the processor speed at several different levels of concurrency (1 thread, 2 threads, 4 threads, and 8 threads).

## Project 3
For this project, I extended the functionality of the client/server file server application.  This project aims to teach the student how to build a simple centralized file sharing system using Python'sPython's socket programming.  I extended this file server so the client could upload files to the server.

## Project 4
I set up the Hadoop MapReduce framework to execute a word count application for this project assignment.  In this assignment, I broke it down into two parts.  I set up the virtual cluster of 3 nodes in the first part of the project and then installed the Hadoop framework.  For the second part of the project, I ran several test applications on the Hadoop cluster that I created in step one.
